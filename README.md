"pyinvoice" is a Python tool to generate invoices using a custom XML format and RML.

This tool was generated as an ad-hoc solution, the initial code is from 2006
or so and was actually never intended to be published. Therefore the code-style
is sometimes Java-like. It was only open-sourced because of requests from
members in the Python User Group Berlin. However I realize that there are
still several glitches to make it work nicely on other computers.

This branch contains preliminary work to rewrite the tool using modern
Python 3. It is currently non-functional.
